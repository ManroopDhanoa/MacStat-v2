# CPU Temperature and Memory Usage Tracking

This project provides a CPU temperature tracking feature and a memory usage tracking feature. It is designed to access the System Management Controller (SMC) to read and display the CPU temps in Fahrenheit aswell as memory usage in gb.

## Features


### CPU Temperature Tracking

- **Functionality**: Accesses the System Management Controller (SMC), reads raw data, and converts it to human-readable Fahrenheit.
- **Implementation**:

This feature was implemented in C and Objective-C. The process involves:

  - Accessing the SMC and cloning its dictionary using `IOServiceMatching`.
  - Reading the raw mutable data from the SMC.
  - Usaging bridging headers to convert the C code that retrieved the data into "swift friendly" form.
  - Closing the SMC.
  - Swift calling the C functions and preforming the data value conversion to FÂ° to be displayed to the end user
- **Challenges**:
  - Finding specific SMC keys for the new 3nm M3 Pro chips.
  - Working with low-level memory without proper documentation for what I was trying to accomplish .
  - Lack of an SDK from Apple for temperature tracking, IOKit is the closest I had.

### Memory Tracking

- **Functionality**: Tracks memory usage of the current task using the mach library built into C.
- **Current Status**:
  - Can return memory usage of the current task.
  - Working on troubleshooting issues that I was experiencing with `proc_allinfo` so I can obtain system-wide memory usage.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to various GitHub forums and communities for providing the necessary SMC keys for the M3 Pro and Max chips. The biggest help and inspo for at least giving me an idea of what i need to do is https://github.com/macmade/Hot
